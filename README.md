Interview Question - A Digital Clock using HTML, CSS and Javascript

The question has multiple phases. As soon as the coding is completed for a stage, we will move to the next one.

## Phase 1 - A Simple Digital Clock
In this phase, we will be making a simple digital clock using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The required format is `hh:mm:ss`.

One Possible Solution <a href="https://gameskraft.github.io/interview-digital-clock/phase1.html">here</a>.

## Phase 2 - An API Based Digital Clock
Assume that our system clock is not working well, we have to use some public API to fetch the current time and update the clock.

## Notes
Suggestions are always welcome. If you think the code can be improved, feel free to raise a PR!

Thanks and Happy Coding!
